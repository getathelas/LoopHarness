/// Entry point for the visionOS build of Loop.
///
/// Loop is a *companion orb*, not an environment: it launches straight into a
/// single volumetric window that lives in the visionOS **Shared Space**, so it
/// floats in your real room (passthrough) alongside every other open app. You
/// look at the orb and pinch-and-hold to talk — the equivalent of holding
/// shift+control on the Mac.
///
/// Why a volume and not an `ImmersiveSpace`: opening *any* immersive space
/// (even a `.mixed` passthrough one) moves the wearer into the exclusive Full
/// Space, where visionOS hides all other apps. Apps only coexist in the Shared
/// Space, and a 3D scene there must be hosted in a volumetric `WindowGroup`.
///
/// Two scenes share one `VisionSession`: the volumetric orb (primary) and a
/// plain 2D conversation window opened from the pill below the orb.

    /// fixed gaze/pinch collision sphere (0.64 m across) and its largest
    /// animated state (the speaking/acknowledge bloom, ~0.6 m across) so
    /// neither is clipped at the volume's edge. The volume is centred on the
    /// RealityView origin, so the orb sits at `[0,0,0]` (see `OrbVolumeView`).
