/// The orb, hosted in a volumetric window in the visionOS Shared Space.

/// This is the Vision Pro port of the iOS/Mac orb. There is deliberately *no*
/// skybox or starfield here (the immersive build had both): a volume's
/// background is clear, so the orb floats against live passthrough — your real
/// room, with every other app still visible around it.
///
/// Interaction is "look at it and pinch": `OrbAvatar` carries an
/// `InputTargetComponent` + `CollisionComponent`, and the pinch gesture below
/// is `.targetedToEntity(orb.root)`. visionOS only routes the pinch to the orb
/// while the wearer's gaze is on that collision shape — so a glance plus a
/// pinch-and-hold is the exact analogue of holding shift+control on the Mac:
/// record while held, send the turn on release.
///
/// All conversation state comes from the shared `VisionSession`; this view
/// only renders it (orb + floating caption) and forwards the pinch. The pill
/// ornament opens the separate 2D conversation window.
